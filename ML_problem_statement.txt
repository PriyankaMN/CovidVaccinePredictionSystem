1. Problem statement : Covid 19 vaccination progress
 ( we'll take the dataset of no of people who got vaccinated last year and then we'll predict in next year how many will be vaccinated)
 
2. choosing this scenario because there are no research papers for this.
   there are few articles about this but its not published yet.

We can do this in 2 ways:

Applying ML algo:-

1. we take the dataset 
2. then do data cleaning
3. apply any 2 machine learning algorithm 
4. and then compare the performance of both 


Applying time series forecasting:-

1. we take the dataset 
2. then do data cleaning
3. apply any time series forecasting algorithm
